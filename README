These scripts may be freely modified for personal or commercial purposes but may not be republished for profit without prior consent.

If you find this script useful or have ideas for improving it, please let me know. It is compatible with Outlook 2016 for Mac and intended for use with volume license editions of Office 2016 for Mac. Office 365 customers should not disable Outlook's startup windows because users need to activate the software prior to connecting to their Exchange Online accounts and Autodiscover should already work correctly.

Office 2016 for Mac requires OS X 10.10 Yosemite or higher. Therefore, this script supports only OS X 10.10 and higher.


Purpose of the Outlook Exchange Setup 5.0 scripts

An administrator can modify these scripts to assist his or her Outlook users with the setups of their Exchange server accounts. Every company's network is different but I've designed the script to provide enough ideas for a novice scripter to adapt it for use in his or her network in just a few minutes.

The script assumes the user's Full Name (also called the "Display name" in Active Directory environments) and email address are in the form of:

	"First Last" and "first.last@domain.com"

But an administrator can easily modify it for other variations such as:

	"Last, First" and "first@domain.com

The script works especially well if the Mac is bound to Active Directory where the user's OS X Account Name (short name) matches the "User logon name" in Active Directory.

An administrator must first edit the OutlookExchangeSetup5.0.scpt script in "Script Editor.app" found in /Applications/Utilities and modify it with server names appropriate to the network. If the user's computer login (short name, long name, etc.) is consistent with his Exchange server's login then it will work with little need for modification.


How do these scripts differ from the previous scripts?

The primary script no longer triggers using an Outlook Schedule. Microsoft removed Schedules in Outlook 2016. This new script now uses a launchd agent to watch for sepcific files in the current user's home folder. Those files are created when the user launches Outlook for the first time. As soon as launchd sees the new files, it runs the script to configure the Exchange account. The end result is the user will launch Outlook for the first time and Outlook should almost immediately prompt for his or her Exchange account password.

This script does not support Microsoft Entourage. It also does not support Microsoft Outlook 2011 (although, I may see about modifying it to do so if demand warrants.)

The secondary script is included as a convenience to administrators for bundling together the primary script, the launchd agent and included configuration profiles into an Apple Installer package file (.pkg). Administrators may prefer to use other tools for packaging for deployment.

Note: The following bullet points complete the list of options that can be set for Exchange, Public folder and LDAP settings missing from the original scripts.

• Added the ability to set the Exchange Server SSL
• Added the ability to set the Exchange Server SSL port number

• Added the option to turn off the "Send & Receive All" schedule. This schedule applies to POP and IMAP accounts only and does nothing with Exchange accounts.

• Added a "Setup check" section to alert users if an Exchange account has already been configured in Entourage. The script is only necessary the first time a user needs to configure Entourage but some users double-click the script again instead of just launching Entourage. This is an effort to prevent a user from setting up a second account in Entourage pointing to the same Exchange account.

• Changed the Account Name to display "Mailbox - Last, First" (or whatever selected name format is selected) to match the display that Outlook for Windows users see.

• Added a customizable error message in case the Exchange account setup fails.
